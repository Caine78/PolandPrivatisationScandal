# PolandPrivatisationScandal
I am trying to create the Report on the situation in Warsaw, Poland. There were few thousands of the buildings, that been returned to the people who were owners of that property. One small problem. Many buildings been returned to the people, that never had anything to with them. First thing that they did after repossesion, was raising a previous Council Tenants rent. x4. Quick debt and eviction order. Building sold and you cannot apparently reverse that operation. I am not saying the people shouldn't have their properties. However, the people that take over the building has nothing to do with the original owner. The court is making a decision based on few pieces of paper and it is making Council Tenants, Private Tenants, with the worst landlord on this planet. It is a pure corruption.
